# pkhex-js

PKHeX reproduction in JavaScript for Node.JS with zero dependencies.

It is not supposed to be a faithful implementation to the original design, but to learn how the software interacts with save files and how they work under the hood.

## What it does:

- [x] Check for the game version based on save.

## Acknowledgments

The `FileInfo` module on `modules/FileInfo.js` is a low reproduction of C# File API, and it was extracted from [wshxbqq/io-info](https://github.com/wshxbqq/io-info).
